# Leaves From the Vine: A Tribute to Uncle Iroh

## Summary

This repository contains code that supports my Leaves From the Vine full-stack application. The Leaves From the Vine app is a tribute to Uncle Iroh from Nickelodeon's _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ cartoon series. The app provides you with an Uncle Iroh quote every day, spanning the full content of every meaningful quote that he produced over the course of the original series and the _Korrah_ series.

## Contents

- `react-app`: This directory holds the ReactJS frontend content for the app

## Repository Next Steps

I am currently in the data-gathering step of this project. This includes watching every episode of _Avatar_ and taking pain-staking notes on every little thing Uncle Iroh says. After all quotes have been gathered, they will be stored in a database and a backend RESTful API will be built to give access to all those quotes. The frontend will leverage that API to provide meaningful quotes in an aesthetic way for users.
